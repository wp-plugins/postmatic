				<h3>Jetpack Import FAQ</h3>
				<h4>Will my subscribers be alerted to the change?</h4>
				<p>No. The import process is invisible to subscribers. They will not be alerted nor will they need to opt-in again.</p>
				<h4>What kind of subscribers are imported?</h4>
				<p>People who have subscribed to new posts on your site will be imported. At this time it\'s not going to be in the cards to import people that have subscribed only to comments on individual posts.</p>
				<h4>Who isn\'t imported?</h4>
				<p>Jetpack supports two kinds of users: people that subscribe to your site with their email address, and people that subscribe to your site with their wordpress.com user identity. At this time we can\'t access the email address of a user which subscribed with their wordpress.com identity. This will in most cases be a very small percentage of your audience.</p>
				<h4>What happens if something goes wrong? Will my Jetpack subscribers be safe?</h4>
				<p>If something goes wrong with the import you will be notified of the error. Your Jetpack subscribers list lives on wordpress.com and will always be there in case you need it again.</p>

				<h3>Mailpoet Import FAQ</h3>
				<h4>Will my subscribers be sent a notification?</h4>
				<p>No. The import process is invisible to subscribers.</p>
				<h4>Which of my subscribers will be imported?</h4>
				<p>We have a very strict policy regarding user imports: <em>we will never allow anyone to be subscribed to a blog running Posmatic without them having opted in</em> (such as subscriber lists bought and imported in bulk for spamming). Because of this we will not import any Mailpoet subscribers unless the following two conditions are true:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>The user has opened an email you sent through Mailpoet</li>
				<li>The user has clicked a link within an email you sent through Mailpoet</li>
				</ol>
				<h5>Why so strict?</h5>
				<p>Bulk importing unwilling users and marking them as opted-in is easy in Mailpoet. If we did not hold our import to a higher standard the magic button below would allow those unwilling users to be imported into Postmatic. And then they would spam your grandmother. Nobody wants that. Plus, if a subscriber does not open or interact with your emails maybe they aren\'t all that good of a match anyway, right? Think of it as spring cleaning :)</p>
				<h4>Can I import multiple lists?</h4>
				<p>Yes. Re-run this importer with as many lists as you like. Postmatic will not create duplicate subscribers.</p>
				<h4>Does Postmatic have lists like Mailpoet does? Is there any way to organize subscribers?</h4>
				<p>No, we do not have a concept of multiple lists. All users are the same in Postmatic. If list segmentation is important to you please let us know by visiting our support site. You\'ll find the link to the right.</p>
				<h4>What will happen to my Mailpoet subscribers?</h4>
				<p>Mailpoet and Postmatic store subscribers in different places within your WordPress database. Your Mailpoet subscribers will always be available to you provided you have Mailpoet activated.</p>
