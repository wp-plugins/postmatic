What’s the one thing people all over the world do a gazillion times a day? Check their email.
So that’s how Postmatic gets your content in front of your readers.
It's the easiest way for readers of your WordPress blog to see your content and interact with you. And each other.

Use Postmatic to let your users subscribe to comments. Instead of just being notified, they add a reply right from their inbox.

Send newsletters and posts in a beautiful mobile-ready template and let your subscribers send back a comment just by writing an email.
