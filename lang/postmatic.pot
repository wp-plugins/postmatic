"\t\t\t\t<h4>Which of my subscribers will be imported?</h4>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>We have a very strict policy regarding user imports: <em>we will "
"never allow anyone to be subscribed to a blog running Posmatic without them "
"having opted in</em> (such as subscriber lists bought and imported in bulk "
"for spamming). Because of this we will not import any Mailpoet subscribers "
"unless the following two conditions are true:</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<ol>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<li>The user has opened an email you sent through Mailpoet</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<li>The user has clicked a link within an email you sent through "
"Mailpoet</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t</ol>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h5>Why so strict?</h5>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>Bulk importing unwilling users and marking them as opted-in is "
"easy in Mailpoet. If we did not hold our import to a higher standard the "
"magic button below would allow those unwilling users to be imported into "
"Postmatic. And then they would spam your grandmother. Nobody wants that. "
"Plus, if a subscriber does not open or interact with your emails maybe they "
"aren't all that good of a match anyway, right? Think of it as spring "
"cleaning :)</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h4>Can I import multiple lists?</h4>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>Yes. Re-run this importer with as many lists as you like. "
"Postmatic will not create duplicate subscribers.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h4>Does Postmatic have lists like Mailpoet does? Is there any way "
"to organize subscribers?</h4>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>No, we do not have a concept of multiple lists. All users are the "
"same in Postmatic. If list segmentation is important to you please let us "
"know by visiting our support site. You'll find the link to the right.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h4>What will happen to my Mailpoet subscribers?</h4>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>Mailpoet and Postmatic store subscribers in different places "
"within your WordPress database. Your Mailpoet subscribers will always be "
"available to you provided you have Mailpoet activated.</p>\n"
